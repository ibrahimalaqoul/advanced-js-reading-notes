# Terms :
* Middleware : is a function can access the request , the response of the object and to the next middleware function .

* Request Object : in simple words this is the HTTP request to be sent to the server or ApI.(get,post,put,delete,use...etc).

* Response Object : is the HTTP response sent from the server to the data we requested for.

* middleware application : is  an app we creat by middleware level application such as : auth , logging , third-party middlewares.
Routing middleware : is the middleware where can we control which route we want to go to.
* Test Driven Diveloment :
it's a test which drive our code to it's path, in other word it test if our code follows the test or not.

* Behavioural Testing is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing, It is usually a functional testing.
 

# Preview 
*  middlewares , express routing , ES6 classes.
* the same three topics especially ES6 classes.
* The whole wireframe subject.

# summary :
* middleware functions  are functions access the request and the response Also can access the next middleware functions (in other words it can control the response itself after if will be recieved).
* Es6 classes : are special functions or type of tamplate which create constructors or objects .
handle routing is kindly middleware function ( as we used to use it with routes but without next param).
you can creat custom middlewares with specefication or customization you want (authirization,logging,RestApi).

* Routing methods are many , we can use any of them as long as we need it.
* The class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
